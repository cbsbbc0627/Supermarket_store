Goal: 
This is a project that I want to pratice my data explortatory analysis and simple machine learning model ability. 

## About Dataset 
In the dataste, we'll be given data of different stores of a supermarket company as per their store IDs which for ease has been converted to positive integers. 

Some explanation for columns: 

Store_Area: Physical Area of the store in yard square.

This can be divided into two categories: graphical analysis and non-graphical analysis. 
Normally, we will conduct in following steps: 
1.   Importing Python libraries 
2.   Structured Based Data Exploration - evaluate for structure, columns and data types. The goal of this to understand your dataset. 
3.   Handling Missing Values & Outliers 
4.   Data Visualizations 
     *   Distribution
     *   Relationship 
     *   Correlation Analysis
